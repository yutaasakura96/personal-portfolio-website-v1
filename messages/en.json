    "aboutMeDescription": "Before transitioning into tech, I spent 8 years in the construction industry as a construction foreman. These experiences shaped my ability to lead teams, solve problems, and focus on delivering high-quality results, all of which I now apply to my work as a web developer. Recently, I graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo’s full-time full-stack web development bootcamp, where I honed my skills in web development. I am actively seeking a full-stack developer role where I can continue growing and contributing to meaningful projects. I’m driven by a love for learning and the endless pursuit of knowledge, as I believe it brings purpose to everything I do. My goal is to create impactful, user-centered projects while collaborating with teams to build innovative solutions. I also look forward to one day mentoring other aspiring developers. I have a particular interest in JavaScript and React, and in my free time, I enjoy bouldering, skateboarding, bodybuilding, and practicing yoga.",
