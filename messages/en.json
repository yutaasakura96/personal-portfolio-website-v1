    "aboutMeDescription": "Before transitioning into tech, I spent 8 years in the construction industry as a construction foreman. These experiences shaped my ability to lead teams, solve problems, and focus on delivering high-quality results, all of which I now apply to my work as a full-stack web developer. Shortly after I graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo’s full-time full-stack web development bootcamp, where I honed my skills in web development, I joined Tierline Inc. as a full-stack web developer. I’m driven by a love for learning and the endless pursuit of knowledge, as I believe it brings purpose to everything I do. I aim to build seamless, efficient web applications that enhance user experience while meeting business goals, working closely with teams to deliver reliable, scalable solutions. I also look forward to one day mentoring other aspiring developers. I have a particular interest in JavaScript, Vue.js, React, and in my free time, I enjoy bouldering, skateboarding, bodybuilding, and practicing yoga.",
