## 📋 Key Components

### 🔝 Call to Action (Scroll to Top)

The `CallToAction` component tracks the scroll position and displays a "scroll to top" button when the user has scrolled down the page. It uses React's `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to handle the scroll event.

### 👨‍💻 About Me Section

The `AboutMe` component provides a detailed background about my journey, including a transition from the construction industry to web development. It features flip card animations to display my technical skills. A clean, responsive layout with smooth transitions enhances the user experience.

### 🎡 Slider Component

A skills and technologies carousel, using `react-slick`, showcases my development expertise, including tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Ruby, and more. The slider is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### ✉️ Contact Form

The contact form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and a message, with real-time validation. After submission, the form sends data to an API endpoint that uses **Nodemailer** to send emails directly. Success and error messages are displayed using **React Toastify**.

### 📜 Diagonal Drawer Menu

The diagonal drawer navigation system enhances mobile usability, providing users with a sleek and engaging way to navigate the website. It's designed to adapt to different screen sizes and provides smooth animations.

### 🔗 Footer

The footer includes social media links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram) and copyright information, styled with custom fonts and colors.
