# 🎨 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills as a Software Engineer . It features a fully responsive multi-page design built with modern web technologies, including React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Nodemailer.

Now with internationalization (i18n) support, the website is available in both English and Japanese, providing a localized experience for users. The language switcher allows seamless toggling between languages, ensuring accessibility for a global audience.

The website also includes extensive accessibility improvements, providing a better experience for all users.

## 📋 Key Components

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) Support

The website now supports multiple languages (English and Japanese) using next-intl.

	•	Language Switcher: Allows users to toggle between supported languages (English and Japanese).
	•	Dynamic Content: All hardcoded strings have been replaced with translation keys, including navigation, section titles, and labels.
	•	Translation Files: Language files (en.json, ja.json) manage translations and ensure easy scalability for future language support.


### 🔝 Call to Action (Scroll to Top)

The `CallToAction` component tracks the scroll position and displays a "scroll to top" button when the user has scrolled down the page. It uses React's `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to handle the scroll event.

### 👨‍💻 About Me Section

The `AboutMe` component provides a detailed background about my journey, including a transition from the construction industry to web development. It features flip card animations to display my technical skills. A clean, responsive layout with smooth transitions enhances the user experience.

### 🎡 Slider Component

A skills and technologies carousel, using `react-slick`, showcases my development expertise, including tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Ruby, and more. The slider is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### ✉️ Contact Form

The contact form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and a message, with real-time validation. After submission, the form sends data to an API endpoint that uses **Nodemailer** to send emails directly. Success and error messages are displayed using **React Toastify**.

### 📜 Diagonal Drawer Menu

The diagonal drawer navigation system enhances mobile usability, providing users with a sleek and engaging way to navigate the website. It's designed to adapt to different screen sizes and provides smooth animations.

### 🔗 Footer

The footer includes social media links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram) and copyright information, styled with custom fonts and colors.

### 🧑‍🦯 Accessibility Enhancements

The site was optimized with extensive accessibility features:
	•	Semantic HTML Structure: All sections and components follow a clear, accessible layout with appropriate roles.
	•	ARIA Labels: Descriptive labels were added across buttons, links, and interactive elements to improve screen reader support.
	•	Keyboard Navigation: Enhanced keyboard accessibility with focusable elements and navigation cues.
	•	Slider and Carousel: Screen readers can interpret each item with added ARIA labels and roles.
